#+TITLE: Clojure Telegram Bot

This library is inspired by the excellent [python-telegram-bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org/) library. Making bots with python-telegram-bot is a pleasure and a breeze. However, doing the same with Clojure should be even easier. 

That's the goal.


* Usage
First you need to produce your telegram map. There are many ways to do that, the simplest one is based on providing token as plain text:

#+begin_src clojure
  (require '[telegram.bot.core :as bot])

  (def telegram (bot/from-token "YOUR_TOKEN"))
#+end_src

However this is the least recommended way, as it's very insecure â€” you have to pass your token around the code base, and that's always a bad idea with secrets. Instead there's a bunch of helper functions to get the token from all kinds of places of varying security:

** Environment variables
Very popular and useful if deploying to services like Heroku. Set an environment variable ~BOT_TOKEN~ to use it:

#+begin_src clojure
  (def telegram (bot/from-env))
#+end_src

** Password managers
Another way is to get your token from password and secrets managers. Two are supported out of the box: [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][pass]] and [[https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/][1Password CLI]].

*** pass
Normally you would use pass from command line like this:

#+begin_src bash
  pass my-bot/token
#+end_src

So for example above the usage would be:

#+begin_src clojure
  (def telegram (bot/from-pass "my-bot/token"))
#+end_src

*** 1Password
For 1Password CLI you need to provide an item name or ID (better) and field name where the token is stored. So if you have a 1Password item called ~my-bot~ and a field called ~token~, your CLI command would be:

#+begin_src bash
  op item get "ITEM_ID" --fields "FIELD_NAME"
#+end_src

So the corresponding code is:

#+begin_src clojure
  (def telegram (bot/from-op "ITEM_ID" "FIELD_NAME"))
#+end_src
